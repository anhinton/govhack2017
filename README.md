# Govhack 2017

My hack for [Govhack 2017](http://govhack.org.nz/). 

The day before Govhack started I was standing in a shop looking out
onto a busy Karangahape Road intersection, talking to the shop owner
about how there were lots of traffic accidents on the
intersection. Mostly they were trying to convince an employee to cross
at the pedestrian crossing rather than shooting between parked
cars. Someone suggested that surely information about how many
accidents happened at that intersection must be online somewhere, and
they searched on Google to find it. They couldn't find it.

This hack attempts to at least answer the question: how many traffic
accidents happen at this intersection?

See the hack in 'action' at [govhack2017.html](govhack2017.html).
