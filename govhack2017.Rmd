The day before [Govhack 2017](http://govhack.org.nz/govhack-nz-2017/)
started I was picking up my weekly comic book pulls from Heroes for
Sale on K Road at about 6pm. We were talking, as you do, about
crossing at the pedestrian crossing, looking out the door at the busy
evening traffic. Someone mentioned that there were heaps of traffic
accidents on the intersection of Karangahape and Newton Roads, and
that trying to jay-walk there would be suicidal.

We live in the time of Google, so of course we tried looking online
for information about how many crashes there were out Heroes for
Sale's front door, but we came up blank. That's when I decided what my
hack for the weekend would be: find out how many crashes happened
outside my local comic book shop.


## Data source

I used the
[disaggregated crash data](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/safety/safety-resources/road-safety-information-and-tools/disaggregated-crash-data/) 
from [Waka Kotahi](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/) to try to answer this question. 
The data set has is available as as a 62MB CSV file,
[Disaggregated-crash-data.csv](Disaggregated-crash-data.csv).
An accompanying metadata file is also available,
[disaggregated-crash-data-metadata.csv](disaggregated-crash-data-metadata.csv).

```{r loadData, echo = FALSE}

## this file is *NOT* in UTF-8. best guess at encoding:
rawData = rawToChar(
    readBin("Disaggregated-crash-data.csv", "raw", 100000))
encoding = stringi::stri_enc_detect(rawData)[[1]]$Encoding[1]

## read the data using this encoding
crashData = read.csv(file = "Disaggregated-crash-data.csv",
                     fileEncoding = encoding)

```

```{r loadMetaData, echo = FALSE}

## this file is *NOT* in UTF-8. best guess at encoding:
rawMeta = rawToChar(
    readBin("disaggregated-crash-data-metadata.csv", "raw", 100000))
encoding = stringi::stri_enc_detect(rawMeta)[[1]]$Encoding[1]

## read the data using this encoding
crashMetadata = read.csv(file = "disaggregated-crash-data-metadata.csv",
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                         fileEncoding = toupper(encoding))
## drop empty columns
crashMetadata = crashMetadata[, 1:2]

```

```{r lowercaseVariables, echo = FALSE}
## variable names to lower case
names(crashData) = tolower(names(crashData))

```

These data record crashes attended by NZ Police in which someone was
at least minorly injured. The data includes counts of injuries,
nearest streets or other locations, and much more. There are 
`r ncol(crashData)` variables for each crash, which are detailed further
in my [data exploration document](exploration.html).

## The location

![Map of the intersection of Karangahape and Newton Roads, Auckland © [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) contributors](images/intersectionMap.png)

I'm interested in the intersection of Karangahape and Newton Roads in
Newton, Auckland. For reasons detailed in
my [data exploration document](exploration.html) there was no easy way
to search for data by map co-ordinates, so instead I looked for
crashes occurring at combinations of the following street names:

```{r streetNames, echo = FALSE}

rawStreetNames = c(
    "Abbey St",         # for some reason street = "ST"
    "Great North Road", # while road = "ROAD"
    "Gundry St",    # go figure
    "Karangahape Road",
    "Newton Road",
    "Ponsonby Road")

streetNames = toupper(rawStreetNames)

showStreetNames = function() {
    paste("  + ", rawStreetNames, sep = "", collapse = "\n")
}

```

`r showStreetNames()`

## How many crashes?

```{r crashDates, echo = FALSE}
minYear = min(intersectionData$crash_year)
maxYear = max(intersectionData$crash_year)
nCrashes = nrow(intersectionData)
```

According to my exploration there were **`r nCrashes`** crashes on our
intersection between `r minYear` and `r maxYear`.

The following plot shows the number of crashes on this intersection by
year:

```{r crashesByYear, echo = FALSE}

crashesByYear = table(intersectionData$crash_year)
barplot(
    height = crashesByYear,
    las = 2,
    main = paste("Number of crashes near Karangahape Road",
                 "and Newton Road intersection",
                 sep = "\n"),
    xlab = "year",
    ylab = "number of crashes")

```

### Crashes by injury severity

```{r crashesBySeverity, echo = FALSE}
nFatalCrashes =
    sum(intersectionData$fatal_count > 0)
nSeriousCrashes =
    sum(intersectionData$seriousinj_count > 0)
nMinorCrashes =
    sum(intersectionData$minorinj_count > 0)
```

`r nFatalCrashes` crashes resulted in fatal injuries,
`r nSeriousCrashes` crashes resulted in serious injuries, and 
`r nMinorCrashes` crashes resulted in minor injuries.

```{r crashesSeverityYear, echo = FALSE}

crashesSeriousYear = aggregate(
    formula = seriousinj_count ~ crash_year,
    data = intersectionData[intersectionData$seriousinj_count > 0, ],
    FUN = "length")
crashesSeriousYear = merge(
    x = crashesSeriousYear,
    y = data.frame(crash_year = minYear:maxYear),
    all.y = TRUE)
crashesSeriousYear[is.na(crashesSeriousYear)] = 0

barplot(
    height = crashesSeriousYear[, 2],
    axes = FALSE,
    las = 2,
    main = "Crashes resulting in serious injury",
    names.arg = crashesSeriousYear[, 1],
    xlab = "year",
    ylab = "number of crashes")
axis(side = 2,
     at = min(crashesSeriousYear[, 2]):max(crashesSeriousYear[, 2]),
     las = 2)

crashesMinorYear = aggregate(
    formula = minorinj_count ~ crash_year,
    data = intersectionData[
        intersectionData$minorinj_count > 0
        & intersectionData$seriousinj_count == 0, ],
    FUN = "length")

barplot(
    height = crashesMinorYear[, 2],
    las = 2,
    main = "Crashes resulting in minor injury",
    names.arg = crashesMinorYear[, 1],
    xlab = "year",
    ylab = "number of crashes")

```

### Number of injuries

```{r injuryCounts, echo = FALSE}
nFatalInjuries = sum(intersectionData$fatal_count)
nSeriousInjuries = sum(intersectionData$seriousinj_count)
nMinorInjuries = sum(intersectionData$minorinj_count)
```

There have been `r nFatalInjuries` fatal injuries, 
`r nSeriousInjuries` serious injuries, and `r nMinorInjuries` minor injuries, 
in these `r nCrashes` crashes.


```{r injuriesByYear, echo = FALSE}

seriousInjuriesByYear = aggregate(
    formula = seriousinj_count ~ crash_year,
    data = intersectionData,
    FUN = "sum")
minorInjuriesByYear = aggregate(
    formula = minorinj_count ~ crash_year,
    data = intersectionData,
    FUN = "sum")
injuriesByYear = merge(
    x = seriousInjuriesByYear,
    y = minorInjuriesByYear)

barplot(
    height = t(injuriesByYear[, 2:3]),
    args.legend = list(x = "top"),
    beside = TRUE,
    las = 2,
    legend.text = c("serious injuries", "minor injuries"),
    main = "Number of injuries by severity",
    names.arg = injuriesByYear[, 1],
    xlab = "year",
    ylab = "injuries")

```

### Crash location in detail

I thought it would be intereseting to look closer at *where* these
crashes occurred. Here I have assumed that the variable `crash_locn1`
indicates the street on which the crash occurred, and `crash_locn2`
the nearest side street. With that in mind, the following plot shows
the number of crashes by location:

```{r crashLocation, echo = FALSE}

crashLocation = paste(
    intersectionData$crash_locn1,
    intersectionData$crash_locn2,
    sep = " & ")
crashLocation = sort(table(crashLocation))

opar = par(mar = c(5.1, 20.1, 4.1, 2.1))
barplot(
    height = crashLocation,
    horiz = TRUE,
    las = 1,
    main = "Crashes by location")
par(opar)

```
